/*
 * Functions for diff, match and patch.
 * Computes the difference between two texts to create a patch.
 * Applies the patch onto another text, allowing for errors.
 *
 * @author fraser@google.com (Neil Fraser)
 *
 * STL-only port by snhere@gmail.com (Sergey Nozhenko)
 * and some tweaks for std::string by leutloff@sundancer.oche.de (Christian Leutloff)
 * rebased on the current C# version and added constexpr-ness by ...@... (Gunter Sp√∂cker):
 *
 * Here is a trivial sample program:

#include "diff_match_patch.h"
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    diff_match_patch<all_traits<std_wstring_traits, chrono_clock_traits, std_container_traits>> dmp;

    wstring str1 = L"First string in diff";
    wstring str2 = L"Second string in diff";

    wstring strPatch = dmp.patch_toText(dmp.patch_make(str1, str2));
    auto    out(dmp.patch_apply(dmp.patch_fromText(strPatch), str1));
    wstring strResult(out.text2);

    // here, strResult will equal str2 above.
    std::wcout << strResult << "\n";
    return 0;
